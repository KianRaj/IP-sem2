## üìò Overview

This project focuses on exploring biological relationships using **Knowledge Graph Embeddings** (KGE). Leveraging advanced models and message-passing architectures, we aim to understand complex interactions in biological data such as protein-protein interactions, molecular interactions, and gene-disease relationships.

## üß™ Objectives

- Build and analyze **Knowledge Graphs** for biological domains.
- Utilize different embedding techniques including:
  - **BioCurie Embedding Representations**
  - **Message Passing Representations**
- Explore and compare KGE models like:
  - `ComplEx`
  - `PairRE`
  - `TransE`
  - `CompGCN`  
- Deploy experiments at scale using **Kubernetes-based distributed training**.
